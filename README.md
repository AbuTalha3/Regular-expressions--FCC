# Regular-expressions--FCC
**Regular expressions**, often shortened to `"regex" or "regexp"`, are patterns that help programmers match, search, and replace text. `Regular expressions` are powerful, but can be difficult to understand because they use so many special characters.

In this spam 'filter project', you'll learn about capture groups, `positive lookaheads`, `negative lookaheads`, and other techniques to match any text you want.
Spam Filter Project
Overview
This project is aimed at developing a spam filter using regular expressions (regex). Regular expressions are patterns that help programmers match, search, and replace text efficiently. By leveraging capture groups, positive lookaheads, negative lookaheads, and other techniques, this spam filter can accurately detect and filter out unwanted messages.

Features
`Regex Patterns`: The project includes a set of regex patterns designed to match common spam phrases, URLs, email addresses, and other suspicious content.
Capture Groups: 'Utilizing capture groups' allows for extracting specific parts of a message for further analysis or filtering.
Lookaheads: Positive and negative lookaheads are used to check for specific conditions ahead of the matched text, enhancing the accuracy of spam detection.
Customizable Filters: Users can customize the `regex patterns` and rules to adapt the spam filter to different types of content and languages.
Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine: git clone https://github.com/yourusername/spam-filter.git
Install any dependencies required by the project: npm install or pip install -r requirements.txt
Modify the 'regex patterns' and rules in the configuration files according to your spam filtering needs.
Run the spam filter script: python spam_filter.py or node spam_filter.js
Test the spam filter with sample messages and adjust the patterns/rules as necessary for better accuracy.
